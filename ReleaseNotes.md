  Thank you Jason!

## 3.3.2  - 2021-12-14

**New features**

- Markdown support for documentation (Experimental)
  This will create a MD document in the Documents folder.
  **Note:** This is not working 100% at the moment. The script will create a MD document but it might be too large if all objects in the environment are documented. 

  Also note that HTML tables are used so that code can be documented as code blocks. This must be supported by the MD Viewer. The *Markdown Viewer* extension in Chrome was used during testing.

  Please report any suggestions to the issue.<br />
  This is based on [Issue 35](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/35)

- Added support for batched export
  This will use batch API to request full info for up to 20 objects per batch to reduce export time
  This can be enabled in setting

  This is based on [Issue 28](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/28)

- Fixed an issue where a checkbox had to be clicked twice to be checked when the list was filtered <br />
  This is based on a known issue

  The separate settings file was not exported with the ID in the name which could cause issues during import

## 3.3.1 (Beta) - 2021-10-28

This is a **BETA** release. It contains core changes for Authentication and Settings management. Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues).

**New features**

- Added support for selecting GCC when using US Government Cloud

- Tenant Specific Setting
  
  The script now supports tenant specific settings. This can be used in scenarios like: only allow delete on you test environments, tenant specific Intune app folders etc.
  Login settings like Cloud and GCC is only used if logging on with a cached token. It will otherwise use the current tenant settings. 

  **Test feedback request:** If there are any users accessing multiple cloud environments like US Government with different GCC levels, please report any issues, working or not. Please report it to [Issue 26](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/26)

  Note: Not all settings have be tested and verified and only Setting Values are supported e.g. last Bulk Compare strings are global. Cached settings might not be updated when connecting to another tenant.   
  
- Log View 
  
  View the log of the current session in the app
  
- Added support for documenting scripts for Word
  This is based on [Issue 34](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/34)

  - New Script options in the Output option tab e.g. enable/disable script documentation, remove PowerShell signature block and documentation styles
  - Supports PowerShell/Shell scripts, Proactive Remediations and Win32 Apps (Requirement/Detection scripts)
  - Scripts will be documented in a separate table with style *HTLM Code* by default. Spell check is disabled for the script text.

- Permission detection if **Use Default Permissions** is enabled
  
  Default permissions will only use the permission consented to the selected Azure App. The script will check the required permissions with the Access Token. If permissions are missing for one or more objects, they will be marked as red in the menu or they can be excluded from the menu by enable **Hide No-access items** in Settings 

**Default Settings Value Changes**

* **Use Default Permissions** is now set to Disabled by default. With the Tenant Specific Settings feature, this can now be enabled globally or per tenant. Consultants accessing multiple environments might not have permissions to grant consent requests so this could be enabled on a global level and then disabled for tenants where the permissions can be added.  

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue when using Json settings where it could not add child settings  

## 3.3.0 (Beta) - 2021-10-17

  See [Readme](README.md#Settings) on how to use this feature
  This is based on [Issue 33](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/33)

- Bulk Compare for exported folders

  The tool can now compare two exported folders 
  This is based on [Issue 32](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/32)

- Support for Azure AD US Government cloud and Azure AD China cloud. Default is Azure AD Public cloud. 

  Change cloud in Settings
  **Note:** This is a major change to the authentication. This may have an impact if a custom configured Azure app is used.
  This is based on [Issue 26](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/26). Please report any problem, progress or testing with US Government/China cloud or if there are any issues when a custom configured Azure app is used. 

- Export can now add Id to the name of the backup file

  This can be used if there are multiple objects with the same name.

  This can be enabled in Settings. Backup file name will be <Name>_<Id>.json. 

- Export/Import/Compare/Delete now supports name filter
  Objects are filtered based on escaped RegEx -nomatch expression so wildcards are not supported.

  This is based on [Issue 27](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/27)

- All objects are returned

  This might take long time in huge environments. 
  Please report feedback on how this works in environments with 1000+ objects e.g. does it take too long time, memory issues etc.
  This is based on [Issue 29](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/29)

- Added support for custom columns
  This must be manually added to the registry.

  See [Readme](README.md#Columns) on how to use this

## 3.2.0 - 2021-08-15

**New features**

- Intune Tools (New View)

  - **ADMX Import** - Configure settings for 3rd party ADMX files with a UI similar to GPMC and create a Custom Profile based on the configured settings

  - **Reg Values** - Add registry values to HKLM or HKCU. This will create and ADMX based on the configured settings and create a Custom Profile in Intune

    See [ADMX Import](ADMXImport.md) for more information on how this works

    **Note:** There is only Import functionality in this version. It does not support updating an existing Custom Profile ADMX policies.
    
  - **Important!** Consider this tool to be in preview at this moment. It has only been tested on Cloud only joined devices. It looks like there are different functionality in the Policy CSP between hybrid and cloud only joined devices. 
    It would be great if anyone testing this on hybrid (or cloud only joined) devices could create an issue and report back the findings, even if it works as intended.

  There are indications that Microsoft is implementing this into the portal UI. The [groupPolicyUploadedDefinitionFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-grouppolicy-grouppolicyuploadeddefinitionfile?view=graph-rest-beta) API suggests that the portal will support this in the future. It would be good if this could be integrated with the Settings Catalog.

- Documentation:

  - Create cover page and table of contents when no template is selected
  - Select CSV delimiter when documenting to a CSV file

- Compare:

  - Select CSV delimiter for bulk compare

**Fixes**

* Authentication

  * The script will start even if it failed to add type TokenCacheHelperEx. 

    This is based on [Issue 21](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/21)

    **Note:** The token will not support caching if this fails. This could be caused by not having write access to the \CS folder or by restrictive ASR policies

* Export/Import

  * Added support for exporting OMA-URI values that are stored encrypted. 

    **Note:** OMA-URI strings and XML Files are stored encrypted. These values will be decrypted and stored in clear text. Be careful if sensitive data is stored e.g. passwords. 

  * Fix for updating existing Autopilot profiles during import. A new property was added that broke the functionality.
    This is based on the feature request in [Issue 17](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/17)

* Documentation

  * New handling of Not Configured properties. Skipping unconfigured properties will now skip all these properties during documentation 
  * Minor fixes to avoid duplicate documentation of properties
